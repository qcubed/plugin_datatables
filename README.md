# QDataTables Plugin

This plugin is a wrapper for the DataTables jQuery plugin. 

This DataTables plugin for jQuery was developed out of the desire to allow highly configurable access to HTML tables with advanced access features.

For detailed information on the plugin itself, please refer to the DataTables web-pages: http://www.datatables.net

This control is now installable by Composer. To install, execute the following from your command line:
```
	composer require datatables/datatables qcubed/plugin_datatables
```
